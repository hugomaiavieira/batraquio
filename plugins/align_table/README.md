# Align table

Let's say you're using Cucumber (or some Cucumber like) to write the functional
tests of your project and you are working with examples on your tests.
Write the examples from scratch is boring, because you should put the spaces and
when you write new examples, the espaces may change. Sometimes the tables came a
really mess like this:

    | name  | email|phone|
    | Hugo Maia Vieira | hugomaiavieira@gmail.com |(22) 2727-2727|
    | Gabriel L. Oliveira | ciberglo@gmail.com |(22) 2525-2525            |
    | Rodrigo Manhães | rmanhaes@gmail.com |      (22) 2626-2626|

Select this text, and press **Ctrl+Alt+a**, the result should be:

    | name                | email                    | phone          |
    | Hugo Maia Vieira    | hugomaiavieira@gmail.com | (22) 2727-2727 |
    | Gabriel L. Oliveira | ciberglo@gmail.com       | (22) 2525-2525 |
    | Rodrigo Manhães     | rmanhaes@gmail.com       | (22) 2626-2626 |

**You should select the entirely block from the first to the last `|`.**
